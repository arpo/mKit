# Progress: mKit (2025-04-03 1:40 PM)

## What Works

*   **Backend Server:** Basic Express server setup using JavaScript (`server/server.cjs`).
*   **Frontend Scaffolding:** React/Vite/TS project initialized in `/client`.
*   **Dependencies:** `react-router-dom`, `zustand`, `@mantine/core`, `@mantine/hooks`, `@mantine/dropzone`, `@tabler/icons-react` installed in client. Root dependencies `dotenv`, `replicate`, `multer`, `@fal-ai/serverless-client` installed.
*   **Core Structure:** `/client`, `/server`, `/memory-bank` directories established. `/server` contains `audio-split` and `audio-to-text` modules.
*   **Routing:** Client routing (React Router) and basic backend API routing (`/api/audio-split`, `/api/audio-to-text`) configured.
*   **UI Library:** Mantine integrated.
*   **Styling:** Project patterns established (Mantine preferred, CSS files secondary).
*   **State Management:** Zustand used, patterns established (individual selectors, logic in `Script.ts`).
*   **Core Patterns:** `useEffect` avoidance, component structure enforced.
*   **Build/Dev Scripts:** Root `package.json` updated for client development and JavaScript server execution (using `.cjs` files).
*   **Server Integration:** Vite proxy and production static serving configured.
*   **Documentation:** Memory Bank core files created/updated. `.clinerules` created.
*   **GCP Deployment Setup (Project: `mkit-app-1`):**
    *   Cloud Run, Cloud Build, Artifact Registry configured.
    *   Dockerfile, `.dockerignore`, `.gcloudignore` created and functional.
*   **Deployment Automation:** `npm run deploy` script functional, relies on Cloud Run environment variables for secrets.
*   **`DropArea` Component:** Allows audio file upload.
*   **Audio Split Endpoint (`/api/audio-split`, Replicate):** Functional locally and deployed. Initiates Replicate job, status polling works, results displayed (needs UI refinement).
*   **Audio-to-Text Endpoint (`/api/audio-to-text`, Fal AI):** Functional locally and deployed.
    *   Uses `@fal-ai/serverless-client` via dynamic `import()` in `server/audio-to-text/controller.cjs`.
    *   Authentication working via `FAL_KEY` environment variable in Cloud Run.
    *   Backend normalizes response structure.
    *   Frontend (`Home/Script.ts`) correctly parses the normalized response.
*   **Git Push Protection:** Resolved by removing secrets from `package.json` deploy script and cleaning Git history.

## What's Left to Build

*   **Result Display UI:** Refine how audio split results (e.g., file links) and transcription text are presented to the user.
*   **Error Handling/UI:** Improve user feedback for various error states (upload fail, processing fail, transcription fail, timeouts).
*   **UI Refinements:** Add ability to clear dropped files/results easily. Potentially improve progress indication.
*   **Testing:** Add unit/integration tests for backend endpoints and frontend logic.
*   **Cleanup:** Remove unused `server/ts` directory and `tsconfig.server.json`. Adjust `.gitignore` if needed.
*   Further application features.

## Current Status

*   Core features (audio upload, splitting via Replicate, transcription via Fal AI) are functional in both local and deployed (Cloud Run) environments.
*   Deployment process is stable.
*   Git history is clean of exposed secrets.
*   Primary focus shifts towards UI/UX refinement, error handling, and testing for the implemented features.

## Known Issues

*   Replicate audio splitting occasionally fails with "Director: unexpected error handling prediction (E6716)" - likely an intermittent Replicate issue. Needs monitoring or more robust error handling on the client.
