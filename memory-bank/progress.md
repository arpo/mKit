# Progress: mKit (2025-04-02)

## What Works

-   **Backend Server:** Basic Express server setup (`server/server.ts`).
-   **Frontend Scaffolding:** React/Vite/TS project initialized in `/client`.
-   **Dependencies:** `react-router-dom`, `zustand`, `@mantine/core`, `@mantine/hooks` installed in client.
-   **Core Structure:** `components`, `pages`, `styles` directories created in client.
-   **Routing:** Basic routing between Home and About pages configured (`client/src/main.tsx`).
-   **UI Library:** Mantine provider configured with default dark theme in `client/src/main.tsx`.
-   **Styling:** Mantine core styles + Global (`global.css`). Custom `Counter.css` styles removed.
-   **Counter Component:** Functional example component (`Counter.tsx`) refactored to use Mantine components (`Paper`, `Text`, `Button`) with separate logic (`Script.ts`) using Zustand.
-   **`useEffect` Avoidance Pattern:** Implemented and documented; logic moved to `Script.ts` and called directly.
-   **Build/Dev Scripts:** Root `package.json` updated for client/server development and builds.
-   **Server Integration:** Vite proxy and production static serving configured.
-   **Initial Documentation:** Memory Bank core files created/updated. `.clinerules` created.
-   **GCP Deployment Setup:** Initial configuration complete (Cloud Run, Cloud Build, Artifact Registry, Service Accounts, IAM roles for `mkit-001`). Application deployed successfully.
-   **Deployment Automation:** `npm run deploy` script created in root `package.json` for automated build and deployment to GCP.

## What's Left to Build

-   Actual features beyond the basic setup/counter example.
-   Building UI using Mantine components.
-   API endpoint implementation on the backend (`/api/*`).
-   Integration of API calls within frontend `Script.ts` files.
-   More complex components and pages using Mantine.
-   Error handling, loading states.
-   Testing (Unit, Integration, E2E).

## Current Status

-   Initial project setup and core pattern definition complete.
-   Mantine UI library integrated with default dark theme.
-   Ready for feature development using the established structure, patterns, and Mantine components.

## Known Issues

-   None currently identified related to the setup.
